# Tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe game, developed with JavaScript. I developed it when I was at the DAW's higher degree training cycle

## How to play
There are 3 game modes: 1 player vs random, 1 player vs IA and 2 players. There are also 2 types of games: Game of 6 tokens or game of 9 tokens.
To start the game you just have to click on "Empezar partida" and the game will start. There are 2 counters, one to measure the entire game time
and the other so that the player has to put a token in a period of time of 30 seconds. Once the game ends, a history of all the games will appear in a table.
